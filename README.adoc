	tv help

for usage. The feeds should be put in `~/tv/rss`. URL's to update the rss should be placed in `~/tv/subscribed`.

	> cat ~/tv/subscribed
	archer  https://showrss.info/show/270.rss
	blackish        https://showrss.info/show/76.rss
	bojack horseman https://showrss.info/show/101.rss
	broad city      https://showrss.info/show/328.rss
	elementary      https://showrss.info/show/207.rss
	house of cards  https://showrss.info/show/274.rss
	how to get away with murder     https://showrss.info/show/8.rss

The format is `<show name>\t<link>`, one show on each line.

When `tv pull` is run, `tv` will go through each rss file in `~/tv/rss`, look up the url in `~/tv/subscribed`, and download the rss.

`tv get` copies the link into `xclip`. If you use some other clipboard manager, please edit the corresponding line in the source.
